# davis_app
Davis (short for data visualisation) is an interactive plotting app created to plot plant growth experiment data. 
The app was designed for the standardised data generated by the plant science team of Agrilution Systems GmbH, but will work with most data in dataframe format with distinct column names. 

The first page of the app lets the user plot from a csv or Excel file containing the raw data. The user can create interactive box, scatter or line plots, and split the data in multiple ways.

The second page of the app lets the user explore past data. This past data is stored in one master file. The features of this page are not as extensive, as the main purpose is for quick exploration of past experiments.
