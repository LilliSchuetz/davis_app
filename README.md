# davis_app
Davis is an interactive plotting app created to plot plant growth experiment data. 
The app was designed for the standardised data generated by the plant science team of Agrilution Systems GmbH, but will work with most data in dataframe format with distinct column names. 

The app provides realtime visualisation of data with applied logics based on the input variables.
